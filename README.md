Repo containing different Deep Learning Projects in Image Classification that I have made.

## Food Vision 101
In this notebook, I bulit a deep learning computer vision model to identify over 100 different types of food, with a total of 101,000 images (75,750 training images and 25,250 testing images).


**Target Score:**

* The Goal is to beat the [DeepFood paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05675) **(77.4% top-1 accuracy)**.
* Alongside the [Food101 paper](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/datasets_extra/food-101/static/bossard_eccv14_food-101.pdf) **(50.76% top-1 accuracy)**.

That were trained on the same dataset.

**Model Score:**

* **validation_accuracy** on previously unseen data of **79.92%**.


**Passed Target Score:** True

## Dog Vision

In this notebook, I made a computer vision neural networks to build an image classification model capable of predicting over 100 different dog breeds.

 


**Model Score:**
* **Multi Class Log Loss** on Kaggle's test dataset of **4.78**.

## Fresh Rotten Fruits

In this notebook, I bulit a deep learning computer vision model to classifiy fruits images into 6 categories:

1. Fresh Apples
2. Fresh Bananas
3. Fresh Oranges
4. Rotten Apples
5. Rotten Bananas
6. Rotten Oranges

**Model Score:**

* **validation_accuracy** on previously unseen data of **98.45%**.
