## Food Vision 101
In this notebook, we are going to bulid a deep learning computer vision to model to identify over 100 different types of food, with a total of 101,000 images (75,750 training images and 25,250 testing images).

**Target score:**

* The Goal is to beat the [DeepFood paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05675) **(77.4% top-1 accuracy)**.
* Alongside the [Food101 paper](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/datasets_extra/food-101/static/bossard_eccv14_food-101.pdf) **(50.76% top-1 accuracy)**.
